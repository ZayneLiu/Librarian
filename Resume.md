## At the very end.
As you may noticed, my formal writing is not something I'm proud of, however it doesn't affect my communication skills as a developer. The skills mentioned above are only the ones I can think of when I'm writing this résumé. As I've said in th e beginning, I'm a fast learner and I've done many demos in different and interesting technologies, however, since I'm still studying at university, I only got a few chances to participate in a project as a team member. So I'm very much looking forward to joining the team.
